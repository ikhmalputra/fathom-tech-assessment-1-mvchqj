                <h1>Technical Assessment - Front-End Developer</h1>
                This is a simple technical assessment designed to gauge your
                technical abilities, specifically problem solving.
                <h2>Task</h2>
                <p>
                    A common pattern in software architecture is the
                    publish/subscribe pattern. The pub/sub pattern is a
                    loosely-coupled, scalable architecture that enables clients
                    to publish and subscribe to events via a central message
                    broker known as an event bus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your task is to complete the event bus implementation (found
                    in the
                    <strong>event-bus.ts</strong> file). The plumbing code has
                    already been completed for you - you need only complete the
                    4 empty method bodies in the
                    <strong>event-bus.ts</strong> file (<em>on</em>,
                    <em>once</em>, <em>off</em>, <em>emit</em>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have as long as necessary to complete this task,
                    however, it is expected that it should take around
                    <strong>30 mins</strong> to complete.
                </p>
                <h3>Required Outcome</h3>
                <p>
                    Complete the 4 methods (<em>on</em>,
                    <em>once</em>, <em>off</em>, <em>emit</em>) of the event bus
                    implementation. Once all 4 methods are completed correctly,
                    the following should occur (demonstrated in the
                    <strong>Implementation</strong> section below):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Clicking on the <strong>Emit Event</strong> buttons in
                        the <strong>On</strong> pane should log the event name
                        and value of the input to the output container as many
                        times as the buttons are clicked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clicking on the <strong>Emit Event</strong> buttons in
                        the <strong>Once</strong> pane should log the event name
                        and value of the input to the output container only
                        once.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Assessment Criteria</h3>
                <p>
                    Although it is expected that you complete this task
                    according to the requirements above, it is not the primary
                    criteria by which you will be assessed. The main assessment
                    criteria for this task will relate to
                    <strong>problem solving</strong>,
                    <strong>code style/readability</strong>,
                    <strong>code quality/safety</strong>,
                    <strong>knowledge of modern web standards</strong> etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will be asked questions relating to these criteria in
                    your interview so take some time to brush up on any of these
                    areas you feel you may be lacking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, be prepared to explain your approach to this solution
                    in your interview.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Above all, try your best, even if you can't complete the
                    task. An incomplete but well-attempted solution is better
                    than a poorly implemented working solution. Good luck!
                </p>
                <h2>Extension Task (Optional)</h2>
                <p>
                    If you found the primary task too easy or simply wish to
                    further demonstrate your abilities you may choose to
                    complete any of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improve or restyle this page</li>
                    <li>Add unit tests for the event bus implementation</li>
                    <li>
                        Build the implementation using a framework of your
                        choice (Vue, Angular, Svelte etc.)
